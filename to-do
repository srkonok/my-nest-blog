Your NestJS REST API boilerplate is already quite comprehensive, but there are a few additional features that could enhance it further. Here are some suggestions:

1. **File Upload Module**:
   - Add a module for handling file uploads with multer
   - Implement cloud storage integration (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
   - Add validation for file types and sizes

2. **Caching Layer**:
   - Implement Redis-based caching for frequently accessed data
   - Add cache decorators for controller methods
   - Configure TTL (Time-to-Live) for different types of data

3. **Logging System**:
   - Implement a more robust logging system with Winston
   - Add log rotation and different log levels
   - Configure production vs development logging

4. **Internationalization (i18n)**:
   - Add support for multiple languages
   - Implement message translation
   - Add language detection middleware

5. **API Versioning Strategy**:
   - Enhance the existing versioning with deprecation notices
   - Add version lifecycle management

6. **Audit Logging**:
   - Track user actions for compliance and security
   - Log all data modifications with user information

7. **Scheduled Tasks**:
   - Add cron jobs for recurring tasks
   - Implement task scheduling with @nestjs/schedule

8. **WebSockets Support**:
   - Add real-time communication capabilities
   - Implement authentication for WebSocket connections

9. **Pagination Utility**:
   - Create a standardized pagination response format
   - Add pagination decorators for controller methods

10. **Database Seeding**:
    - Add scripts for seeding the database with initial data
    - Create development/testing data sets

11. **CI/CD Configuration**:
    - Add GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD pipeline
    - Configure automated testing and deployment

12. **Docker Setup**:
    - Create a Docker Compose configuration for the entire stack
    - Add production-ready Dockerfile with multi-stage builds

13. **API Documentation Enhancements**:
    - Add more detailed examples to Swagger
    - Create a Postman collection export

14. **Monitoring Integration**:
    - Add Prometheus metrics
    - Create Grafana dashboards

Would you like me to implement any of these features for your boilerplate? If so, which one would you prioritize?
